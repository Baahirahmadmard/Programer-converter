# Programer-converter
* We will create such a converter for programers that can convert four types of number to each other.
## Information
* Class: 2nd class (4th semester);
* Group Name (B);
* Group Members{
	 * Bashir Ahmad. 
     * Dawood Shah.
     * Gulahmad.
     * Abdul Wasi.

* Subject (Java);
* Project Name (Programmer calculator);
* Instructor teacher (Eng Sayed Ahmad Sahim);

## Project details:
### Introduction
* These four numbers are used by programmers so here they need to convert one number from these four to another number{
	 * Binary
	 * Octal
	 * Decimal
	 * Hexadecimal
* }
* If this conversion is manually it will take some time for converting operation.
* to calculate these four kind of numbers to each other we need a program to do this work in less time that itâ€™s programmer converter.

### Functionality
* Here we will have 12 functions in this program work as{
	 * Binary to (Octal, Decimal and Hexadecimal);
	 * Octal to (Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal);
	 * Decimal to (Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal);
 	 * Hexadecimal to (Binary, Octal and Decimal);
